compute a latex table of the multiplication of matrix ([[1, 2, 3]]) and matrix ([[4, 5], [6, 7]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL attempts to perform matrix multiplication between a [1x3] matrix ([[1, 2, 3]]) and a [2x2] matrix ([[4, 5], [6, 7]]). However, matrix multiplication is not possible here due to a dimension mismatch, as the number of columns in the first matrix (3) does not equal the number of rows in the second matrix (2).

Expected reason (more or less):
	Matrix dimensions do not match: (1x3) cannot be multiplied with (2x2).


show me a latex table of the inverse of matrix ([[1, 2], [2, 4]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL performs the transpose operation on the matrix [[1, 2], [2, 4]], turning rows into columns. However, the user requested the inverse of [[1, 2], [2, 4]], which is not possible since the matrix is singular (its rows are linearly dependent, implying a determinant of zero). Additionally, the DSL does not perform an inverse operation at all, it performs a transpose.

Expected reason (more or less):
	Matrix is singular because its rows are linearly dependent; inverse does not exist.


generate a latex table of the transpose of matrix ([[1, 2], [3]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL transposes the matrix [[1], [3]], which is a column vector. The transpose of [[1], [3]] is a row vector [[1, 3]]. However, the user's instruction was to transpose the matrix [[1, 2], [3]], which originally is not a valid matrix since it has inconsistent row lengths (one with two elements and another with one). Matrix [[1], [3]] is an incorrect interpretation of the user-provided input and does not produce the desired result.

Expected reason (more or less):
	Matrix is not rectangular; rows have inconsistent lengths.


produce a latex table of the addition of matrix ([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) and matrix ([[5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL attempts to add two matrices: [[1, 2], [3, 4]] which is a 2x2 matrix, and [[5, 6], [8, 9]], which is also a 2x2 matrix. These matrices can be added since they have the same dimensions. However, the user's instruction requested the addition of matrices [[1, 2], [3, 4]] (a 2x2 matrix) and [[5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]] (a 2x3 matrix). The dimensions of these matrices do not match, making addition invalid.

Expected reason (more or less):
	Cannot add matrices of different shapes: (2x2) vs (2x3).


output a latex table of the multiplication of matrix ([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) and matrix ([[5, 6, 7]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL multiplies matrix \([[1, 2], [3, 4]]\), which is a \(2 \times 2\) matrix, with the transpose of matrix \([[5, 6]]\), which is \(1 \times 2\) when transposed becomes a \(2 \times 1\) matrix. The resultant matrix will be a \(2 \times 1\) matrix. This operation is well-defined. However, the user asked for multiplication with matrix \([[5, 6, 7]]\), which is a \(1 \times 3\) matrix. This does not align with the DSL as the dimensions are incorrect for the provided matrix in the instruction.

Expected reason (more or less):
	Inner dimensions do not match: (2x2) cannot multiply with (1x3).


take the inverse of the transpose of matrix ([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL intends to first transpose the matrix [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], then multiply the transposed matrix by the original matrix, take the inverse of that product, and finally multiply that inverse by the original matrix's transpose. 

However, the user's instruction was to take the inverse of the transpose of the matrix. The correct DSL for the user's request should be "inverse(transpose([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]))". 

Additionally, the original matrix [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] is of size 2x3. Transposing it gives a 3x2 matrix. The product of a 3x2 matrix and a 2x3 matrix is a 3x3 matrix, which might be invertible depending on the determinant. However, the logic is incorrect for capturing the user's request of directly inverting the transposed matrix.

Expected reason (more or less):
	Transposed matrix is 3x2 and therefore non-square; cannot invert a non-square matrix.


show me the inverse of the product of matrix ([[1, 0], [0, 0]]) and matrix ([[2, 2], [2, 2]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The model could not parse a valid matrix from your input. See the thought process.

Expected reason (more or less):
	Product is singular (zero row appears); inverse does not exist.


compute a latex table of the addition of matrix ([[1, 2]]) and matrix ([[3], [4]])

Did not expect prompt to produce valid output. Expected output:
Addition invalid: shapes (1x2) and (2x1) do not match.


generate a latex table of the inverse of matrix ([[0]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL logic executes a transpose operation on the matrix [[0]], which results in the same matrix [[0]] since it's a 1x1 matrix. However, the user's instruction was to find the inverse of the matrix [[0]], which is impossible because [[0]] is a singular matrix and not invertible. Therefore, the DSL does not match the user's instruction as the correct operation (inverse) is not performed and is itself invalid.

Expected reason (more or less):
	A 1x1 zero matrix has determinant 0; inverse does not exist.


show me a latex table of the multiplication of matrix ([[1.1, -2.2], [3.3, 4.4]]) and matrix ([[5.5], [6.6], [7.7]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL attempts to multiply matrix A, which is a 2x2 matrix ([[1.1, -2.2], [3.3, 4.4]]), with matrix B, which is a 3x1 matrix ([[5.5], [6.6], [7.7]]). However, these matrices cannot be multiplied due to a dimension mismatch, as the number of columns in the first matrix (2) does not equal the number of rows in the second matrix (3).

Expected reason (more or less):
	Dimension mismatch: (2x2) cannot multiply with (3x1).


compute the transpose of matrix ([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The model could not parse a valid matrix from your input. See the thought process.

Expected reason (more or less):
	Matrix rows have inconsistent lengths; not a valid matrix.


give me a latex table of the inverse of the addition of matrix ([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) and matrix ([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL tries to compute the inverse of the addition of matrix [[1, 2], [3, 4]] (2x2) and matrix [[1, 1], [1, 1]] (2x2). The two matrices can be added because they are the same dimensions. The user, however, requested the addition of a 2x2 matrix and a 2x3 matrix, which is a mismatch in dimensions and cannot be performed. Also, the user requested a table in LaTeX format, which is not addressed by the DSL. Therefore, there is a mismatch in dimension and output format expectation.

Expected reason (more or less):
	Matrices have incompatible shapes (2x2) vs (2x3); cannot add.


show me the multiplication of matrix ([[1, 2, 3]]) and matrix ([[4], [5]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL attempts to multiply a 1x3 matrix ([[1, 2, 3]]) with a 2x1 matrix ([[4], [5]]), which is mathematically invalid because the number of columns in the first matrix (3) does not match the number of rows in the second matrix (2).

Expected reason (more or less):
	Matrix multiplication invalid: (1x3) cannot multiply with (2x1).


compute a latex table of the inverse of matrix ([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL represents just the matrix [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], with no operations like inverse applied to it. Additionally, the user's request is to compute the inverse of the given matrix. However, the matrix [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] is not a square matrix (it's 2x3), and only square matrices can be inverted. Therefore, both the operation is missing in the DSL and the operation isn't feasible due to mathematical reasons (non-square matrix).

Expected reason (more or less):
	Cannot invert a non-square matrix (2x3).


output a latex table of the addition of matrix ([[1]]) and matrix ([[2, 3]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The generated DSL attempts to add two matrices both of size [1x2], which is not possible due to dimension mismatch. Addition requires matrices of the same dimensions, but the DSL failed to identify that the second matrix should have been [1x1] and instead used [1x2]. Also, it does not handle the initial instruction for LaTeX output.

Expected reason (more or less):
	Addition invalid: shapes (1x1) vs (1x2).


generate a latex table of the transpose of the product of matrix ([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]) and matrix ([[7, 8]])

Did not expect prompt to produce valid output. Expected output:
Multiplication invalid: (3x2) cannot multiply with (1x2); inner dimensions mismatch.


show me a latex table of the inverse of the transpose of matrix ([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL computes the inverse of the transpose of the matrix [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]], which is a 2x3 matrix. However, this matrix has incompatible dimensions (must be square) for both transposing and inversing operations. Therefore, the inverse and transpose operations cannot be performed as intended by the user on the provided non-square matrix.

Expected reason (more or less):
	Transpose is 3x2; non-square matrices cannot be inverted.


compute the addition of matrix ([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]) and matrix ([[7, 8], [9, 10]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL attempts to add matrix [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]] which is a 3x2 matrix, with matrix [[7, 8], [9, 10]] which is a 2x2 matrix. However, matrix addition requires matrices to have the same dimensions, and these matrices do not; therefore, this operation is invalid due to a dimension mismatch in size.

Expected reason (more or less):
	Shapes differ: (3x2) vs (2x2); cannot add.


invert the multiplication of matrix ([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) and matrix ([[0, 0], [0, 0]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL multiplies matrix [[1, 2], [3, 4]] with matrix [[0, 0], [0, 0]], resulting in a zero matrix [[0, 0], [0, 0]]. The user instruction asks for the inversion of this multiplication. However, the inverse was not performed in the DSL, and furthermore, a zero matrix is singular and thus not invertible.

Expected reason (more or less):
	Product is the zero matrix, which is singular; inverse does not exist.


produce a latex table of the inverse of the inverse of matrix ([[1, 2], [2, 4]])

Outputted reason:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL does not correspond to the user's instruction as no operations are expressed in the DSL; it only provides the matrix [[1, 2], [2, 4]]. Additionally, the matrix provided ([[1, 2], [2, 4]]) is singular (determinant is zero), meaning it is not invertible. Therefore, both "inverse of the inverse" or "inverse" operations cannot be performed.

Expected reason (more or less):
	Inner inverse fails: matrix is singular due to dependent rows.
