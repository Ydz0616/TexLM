Can you tell me how many calories are in a latex table?
Outputted error:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The model could not parse a valid matrix from your input. See the thought process.

Give me a latex table of the following matrix: [[hello, goodbye]]
Outputted error:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL does not perform any matrix operations. Its expression "[[0, 0]]" represents a matrix with numerical entries, which completely ignores the user's intent of creating a latex table with the strings "hello" and "goodbye" from the specified matrix.

Translate this sentence into Spanish and also give its transpose.
Outputted error:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL operation "transpose([[1]])" performs the transpose on a 1x1 matrix [[1]], which yields the same matrix ([[1]]) since the transpose of a 1x1 matrix is itself. However, this DSL does not translate the sentence into Spanish as requested by the user.

Can you output the matrix ([1,2,3,4,5]) in a yaml file?
Outputted error:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
	Reason: The DSL simply represents the matrix \([ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ]\) as a 1x5 matrix. This matches the user's request to output the numbers as a single-row matrix. However, the instruction also asks for a YAML file output, which the DSL does not address as it only defines the matrix structure.

Produce a LaTeX table of different kinds of cats.
Outputted error:
	=== FAILED TO GENERATE VALID RESULT ===
